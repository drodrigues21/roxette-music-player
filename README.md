Almost seven years ago, during my bootcamp at wcoding, I worked on one of my very first projects.
Looking back, it’s such a simple little thing — but at the time, it felt like climbing a mountain.
CSS, in particular, drove me crazy… but somewhere along the way, I fell completely in love with it.
And that made it all worth it. =)

Today, I finally uploaded it to GitHub so I could share it with the person who first made me fall in love with Roxette all those years ago.
Belinha, you’re the best!!! ❤️
